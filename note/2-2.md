## Strings

Text values are perhaps more fundamental to computer science than even numbers. As a case in point, Python programs are written and stored as text. The native data type for text in Python is called a string, and corresponds to the constructor `str`.

There are many details of how strings are represented, expressed, and manipulated in Python. Strings are another example of a rich abstraction, one that requires a substantial commitment on the part of the programmer to master. This section serves as a condensed introduction to essential string behaviors.

String literals can express arbitrary text, surrounded by either single or double quotation marks.

```python
>>> 'I am string!'
'I am string!'
>>> "I've got an apostrophe"
"I've got an apostrophe"
>>> '您好'
'您好'
```

We have seen strings already in our code, as docstrings, in calls to `print`, and as error messages in `assert` statements.

Strings satisfy the two basic conditions of a sequence that we introduced at the beginning of this section: they have a length and they support element selection.

```python
>>> city = 'Berkeley'
>>> len(city)
8
>>> city[3]
'k'
```

The elements of a string are themselves strings that have only a single character. A character is any single letter of the alphabet, punctuation mark, or other symbol. Unlike many other programming languages, Python does not have a separate character type; any text is a string, and strings that represent single characters have a length of 1.

Like lists, strings can also be combined via addition and multiplication.

```python
>>> 'Berkeley' + ', CA'
'Berkeley, CA'
>>> 'Shabu ' * 2
'Shabu Shabu '
```

**Membership.** The behavior of strings diverges from other sequence types in Python. The string abstraction does not conform to the full sequence abstraction that we described for lists and ranges. In particular, the membership operator `in` applies to strings, but has an entirely different behavior than when it is applied to sequences. It matches substrings rather than elements.

```python
>>> 'here' in "Where's Waldo?"
True
```

**Multiline Literals.** Strings aren't limited to a single line. Triple quotes delimit string literals that span multiple lines. We have used this triple quoting extensively already for docstrings.

```python
>>> """The Zen of Python
claims, Readability counts.
Read more: import this."""
'The Zen of Python\nclaims, "Readability counts."\nRead more: import this.'
```

In the printed result above, the `\n` (pronounced "*backslash en*") is a single element that represents a new line. Although it appears as two characters (backslash and "n"), it is considered a single character for the purposes of length and element selection.

**String Coercion.** A string can be created from any object in Python by calling the `str` constructor function with an object value as its argument. This feature of strings is useful for constructing descriptive strings from objects of various types.

```python
>>> str(2) + ' is an element of ' + str(digits)
'2 is an element of [1, 8, 2, 8]'
```

**Further reading.** Encoding text in computers is a complex topic. In this chapter, we will abstract away the details of how strings are represented. However, for many applications, the particular details of how strings are encoded by computers is essential knowledge. [The strings chapter of Dive Into Python 3](http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/strings.html) provides a description of character encodings and Unicode.

## Trees

Our ability to use lists as the elements of other lists provides a new means of combination in our programming language. This ability is called a *closure property* of a data type. In general, a method for combining data values has a closure property if the result of combination can itself be combined using the same method. Closure is the key to power in any means of combination because it permits us to create hierarchical structures — structures made up of parts, which themselves are made up of parts, and so on.

We can visualize lists in environment diagrams using *box-and-pointer* notation. A list is depicted as adjacent boxes that contain the elements of the list. Primitive values such as numbers, strings, boolean values, and `None` appear within an element box. Composite values, such as function values and other lists, are indicated by an arrow.

Nesting lists within lists can introduce complexity. The *tree* is a fundamental data abstraction that imposes regularity on how hierarchical values are structured and manipulated.

A tree has a root label and a sequence of branches. Each branch of a tree is a tree. A tree with no branches is called a leaf. Any tree contained within a tree is called a sub-tree of that tree (such as a branch of a branch). The root of each sub-tree of a tree is called a node in that tree.

The data abstraction for a tree consists of the constructor `tree` and the selectors `label` and `branches`. We begin with a simplified version.

```python
>>> def tree(root_label, branches=[]):
        for branch in branches:
            assert is_tree(branch), 'branches must be trees'
        return [root_label] + list(branches)
>>> def label(tree):
        return tree[0]
>>> def branches(tree):
        return tree[1:]
```

A tree is well-formed only if it has a root label and all branches are also trees. The `is_tree` function is applied in the `tree` constructor to verify that all branches are well-formed.

```python
>>> def is_tree(tree):
        if type(tree) != list or len(tree) < 1:
            return False
        for branch in branches(tree):
            if not is_tree(branch):
                return False
        return True
```

The `is_leaf` function checks whether or not a tree has branches.

```python
>>> def is_leaf(tree):
        return not branches(tree)
```

Trees can be constructed by nested expressions. The following tree `t` has root label 3 and two branches.

```python
>>> t = tree(3, [tree(1), tree(2, [tree(1), tree(1)])])
>>> t
[3, [1], [2, [1], [1]]]
>>> label(t)
3
>>> branches(t)
[[1], [2, [1], [1]]]
>>> label(branches(t)[1])
2
>>> is_leaf(t)
False
>>> is_leaf(branches(t)[0])
True
```

Tree-recursive functions can be used to construct trees. For example, the nth Fibonacci tree has a root label of the nth Fibonacci number and, for `n > 1`, two branches that are also Fibonacci trees. A Fibonacci tree illustrates the tree-recursive computation of a Fibonacci number.

```python
>>> def fib_tree(n):
        if n == 0 or n == 1:
            return tree(n)
        else:
            left, right = fib_tree(n-2), fib_tree(n-1)
            fib_n = label(left) + label(right)
            return tree(fib_n, [left, right])
>>> fib_tree(5)
[5, [2, [1], [1, [0], [1]]], [3, [1, [0], [1]], [2, [1], [1, [0], [1]]]]]
```

Tree-recursive functions are also used to process trees. For example, the `count_leaves` function counts the leaves of a tree.

```python
>>> def count_leaves(tree):
      if is_leaf(tree):
          return 1
      else:
          branch_counts = [count_leaves(b) for b in branches(tree)]
          return sum(branch_counts)
>>> count_leaves(fib_tree(5))
8
```

**Partition trees.** Trees can also be used to represent the partitions of an integer. A partition tree for `n` using parts up to size `m` is a binary (two branch) tree that represents the choices taken during computation. In a non-leaf partition tree:

- the left (index 0) branch contains all ways of partitioning `n` using at least one `m`,
- the right (index 1) branch contains partitions using parts up to `m-1`, and
- the root label is `m`.

The labels at the leaves of a partition tree express whether the path from the root of the tree to the leaf represents a successful partition of `n`.

```python
>>> def partition_tree(n, m):
        """Return a partition tree of n using parts of up to m."""
        if n == 0:
            return tree(True)
        elif n < 0 or m == 0:
            return tree(False)
        else:
            left = partition_tree(n-m, m)
            right = partition_tree(n, m-1)
            return tree(m, [left, right])
>>> partition_tree(2, 2)
[2, [True], [1, [1, [True], [False]], [False]]]
```

Printing the partitions from a partition tree is another tree-recursive process that traverses the tree, constructing each partition as a list. Whenever a `True` leaf is reached, the partition is printed.

```python
>>> def print_parts(tree, partition=[]):
        if is_leaf(tree):
            if label(tree):
                print(' + '.join(partition))
        else:
            left, right = branches(tree)
            m = str(label(tree))
            print_parts(left, partition + [m])
            print_parts(right, partition)
>>> print_parts(partition_tree(6, 4))
4 + 2
4 + 1 + 1
3 + 3
3 + 2 + 1
3 + 1 + 1 + 1
2 + 2 + 2
2 + 2 + 1 + 1
2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
```

Slicing can be used on the branches of a tree as well. For example, we may want to place a restriction on the number of branches in a tree. A binary tree is either a leaf or a sequence of at most two binary trees. A common tree transformation called *binarization* computes a binary tree from an original tree by grouping together adjacent branches.

```python
>>> def right_binarize(tree):
        """Construct a right-branching binary tree."""
        if is_leaf(tree):
            return tree
        if len(tree) > 2:
            tree = [tree[0], tree[1:]]
        return [right_binarize(b) for b in tree]
>>> right_binarize([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7])
[1, [2, [3, [4, [5, [6, 7]]]]]]
```

## Linked Lists

So far, we have used only native types to represent sequences. However, we can also develop sequence representations that are not built into Python. A common representation of a sequence constructed from nested pairs is called a *linked list*. The environment diagram below illustrates the linked list representation of a four-element sequence containing 1, 2, 3, and 4.

<iframe width="800" height="250" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=four%20%3D%20%5B1,%20%5B2,%20%5B3,%20%5B4,%20'empty'%5D%5D%5D%5D&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

A linked list is a pair containing the first element of the sequence (in this case 1) and the rest of the sequence (in this case a representation of 2, 3, 4). The second element is also a linked list. The rest of the inner-most linked list containing only 4 is `'empty'`, a value that represents an empty linked list.

Linked lists have recursive structure: the rest of a linked list is a linked list or `'empty'`. We can define an abstract data representation to validate, construct, and select the components of linked lists.

```python
>>> empty = 'empty'
>>> def is_link(s):
        """s is a linked list if it is empty or a (first, rest) pair."""
        return s == empty or (len(s) == 2 and is_link(s[1]))
>>> def link(first, rest):
        """Construct a linked list from its first element and the rest."""
        assert is_link(rest), "rest must be a linked list."
        return [first, rest]
>>> def first(s):
        """Return the first element of a linked list s."""
        assert is_link(s), "first only applies to linked lists."
        assert s != empty, "empty linked list has no first element."
        return s[0]
>>> def rest(s):
        """Return the rest of the elements of a linked list s."""
        assert is_link(s), "rest only applies to linked lists."
        assert s != empty, "empty linked list has no rest."
        return s[1]
```

Above, `link` is a constructor and `first` and `rest` are selectors for an abstract data representation of linked lists. The behavior condition for a linked list is that, like a pair, its constructor and selectors are inverse functions.

- If a linked list `s` was constructed from first element `f` and linked list `r`, then `first(s)` returns `f`, and `rest(s)` returns `r`.

We can use the constructor and selectors to manipulate linked lists.

```python
>>> four = link(1, link(2, link(3, link(4, empty))))
>>> first(four)
1
>>> rest(four)
[2, [3, [4, 'empty']]]
```

Our implementation of this kind of abstract data uses pairs that are two-element `list` values. It is worth noting that we were also able to implement pairs using functions, and we can implement linked lists using any pairs, therefore we could implement linked lists using functions alone.

The linked list can store a sequence of values in order, but we have not yet shown that it satisfies the sequence abstraction. Using the abstract data representation we have defined, we can implement the two behaviors that characterize a sequence: length and element selection.

```python
>>> def len_link(s):
        """Return the length of linked list s."""
        length = 0
        while s != empty:
            s, length = rest(s), length + 1
        return length
>>> def getitem_link(s, i):
        """Return the element at index i of linked list s."""
        while i > 0:
            s, i = rest(s), i - 1
        return first(s)
```

Now, we can manipulate a linked list as a sequence using these functions. (We cannot yet use the built-in `len` function, element selection syntax, or `for` statement, but we will soon.)

```python
>>> len_link(four)
4
>>> getitem_link(four, 1)
2
```

The series of environment diagrams below illustrate the iterative process by which `getitem_link` finds the element 2 at index 1 in a linked list. Below, we have defined the linked list `four` using Python primitives to simplify the diagrams. This implementation choice violates an abstraction barrier, but allows us to inspect the computational process more easily for this example.

First, the function `getitem_link` is called, creating a local frame.

<iframe width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=def%20first%28s%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20return%20s%5B0%5D%0Adef%20rest%28s%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20return%20s%5B1%5D%0A%0Adef%20getitem_link%28s,%20i%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20while%20i%20%3E%200%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20s,%20i%20%3D%20rest%28s%29,%20i%20-%201%0A%20%20%20%20return%20first%28s%29%0A%0Afour%20%3D%20%5B1,%20%5B2,%20%5B3,%20%5B4,%20'empty'%5D%5D%5D%5D%0Agetitem_link%28four,%201%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=4&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

The expression in the `while` header evaluates to true, which causes the assignment statement in the `while` suite to be executed. The function `rest` returns the sublist starting with 2.

<iframe width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=def%20first%28s%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20return%20s%5B0%5D%0Adef%20rest%28s%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20return%20s%5B1%5D%0A%0Adef%20getitem_link%28s,%20i%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20while%20i%20%3E%200%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20s,%20i%20%3D%20rest%28s%29,%20i%20-%201%0A%20%20%20%20return%20first%28s%29%0A%0Afour%20%3D%20%5B1,%20%5B2,%20%5B3,%20%5B4,%20'empty'%5D%5D%5D%5D%0Agetitem_link%28four,%201%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=4&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

Next, the local name `s` will be updated to refer to the sub-list that begins with the second element of the original list. Evaluating the `while` header expression now yields a false value, and so Python evaluates the expression in the return statement on the final line of `getitem_link`.

<iframe width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=def%20first%28s%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20return%20s%5B0%5D%0Adef%20rest%28s%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20return%20s%5B1%5D%0A%0Adef%20getitem_link%28s,%20i%29%3A%0A%20%20%20%20while%20i%20%3E%200%3A%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20s,%20i%20%3D%20rest%28s%29,%20i%20-%201%0A%20%20%20%20return%20first%28s%29%0A%0Afour%20%3D%20%5B1,%20%5B2,%20%5B3,%20%5B4,%20'empty'%5D%5D%5D%5D%0Agetitem_link%28four,%201%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

This final environment diagram shows the local frame for the call to `first`, which contains the name `s` bound to that same sub-list. The `first` function selects the value 2 and returns it, which will also be returned from `getitem_link`.

This example demonstrates a common pattern of computation with linked lists, where each step in an iteration operates on an increasingly shorter suffix of the original list. This incremental processing to find the length and elements of a linked list does take some time to compute. Python's built-in sequence types are implemented in a different way that does not have a large cost for computing the length of a sequence or retrieving its elements. The details of that representation are beyond the scope of this text.

**Recursive manipulation.** Both `len_link` and `getitem_link` are iterative. They peel away each layer of nested pair until the end of the list (in `len_link`) or the desired element (in `getitem_link`) is reached. We can also implement length and element selection using recursion.

```python
>>> def len_link_recursive(s):
        """Return the length of a linked list s."""
        if s == empty:
            return 0
        return 1 + len_link_recursive(rest(s))
>>> def getitem_link_recursive(s, i):
        """Return the element at index i of linked list s."""
        if i == 0:
            return first(s)
        return getitem_link_recursive(rest(s), i - 1)
>>> len_link_recursive(four)
4
>>> getitem_link_recursive(four, 1)
2
```

These recursive implementations follow the chain of pairs until the end of the list (in `len_link_recursive`) or the desired element (in `getitem_link_recursive`) is reached.

Recursion is also useful for transforming and combining linked lists.

```python
>>> def extend_link(s, t):
        """Return a list with the elements of s followed by those of t."""
        assert is_link(s) and is_link(t)
        if s == empty:
            return t
        else:
            return link(first(s), extend_link(rest(s), t))
>>> extend_link(four, four)
[1, [2, [3, [4, [1, [2, [3, [4, 'empty']]]]]]]]
>>> def apply_to_all_link(f, s):
        """Apply f to each element of s."""
        assert is_link(s)
        if s == empty:
            return s
        else:
            return link(f(first(s)), apply_to_all_link(f, rest(s)))
>>> apply_to_all_link(lambda x: x*x, four)
[1, [4, [9, [16, 'empty']]]]
>>> def keep_if_link(f, s):
        """Return a list with elements of s for which f(e) is true."""
        assert is_link(s)
        if s == empty:
            return s
        else:
            kept = keep_if_link(f, rest(s))
            if f(first(s)):
                return link(first(s), kept)
            else:
                return kept
>>> keep_if_link(lambda x: x%2 == 0, four)
[2, [4, 'empty']]
>>> def join_link(s, separator):
        """Return a string of all elements in s separated by separator."""
        if s == empty:
            return ""
        elif rest(s) == empty:
            return str(first(s))
        else:
            return str(first(s)) + separator + join_link(rest(s), separator)
>>> join_link(four, ", ")
'1, 2, 3, 4'
```

**Recursive Construction.** Linked lists are particularly useful when constructing sequences incrementally, a situation that arises often in recursive computations.

The `count_partitions` function from Chapter 1 counted the number of ways to partition an integer `n` using parts up to size `m` via a tree-recursive process. With sequences, we can also enumerate these partitions explicitly using a similar process.

We follow the same recursive analysis of the problem as we did while counting: partitioning `n` using integers up to `m` involves either

1. partitioning `n-m` using integers up to `m`, or
2. partitioning `n` using integers up to `m-1`.

For base cases, we find that 0 has an empty partition, while partitioning a negative integer or using parts smaller than 1 is impossible.

```python
>>> def partitions(n, m):
        """Return a linked list of partitions of n using parts of up to m.
        Each partition is represented as a linked list.
        """
        if n == 0:
            return link(empty, empty) # A list containing the empty partition
        elif n < 0 or m == 0:
            return empty
        else:
            using_m = partitions(n-m, m)
            with_m = apply_to_all_link(lambda s: link(m, s), using_m)
            without_m = partitions(n, m-1)
            return extend_link(with_m, without_m)
```

In the recursive case, we construct two sublists of partitions. The first uses `m`, and so we prepend `m` to each element of the result `using_m` to form `with_m`.

The result of `partitions` is highly nested: a linked list of linked lists, and each linked list is represented as nested pairs that are `list` values. Using `join_link` with appropriate separators, we can display the partitions in a human-readable manner.

```python
>>> def print_partitions(n, m):
        lists = partitions(n, m)
        strings = apply_to_all_link(lambda s: join_link(s, " + "), lists)
        print(join_link(strings, "\n"))
>>> print_partitions(6, 4)
4 + 2
4 + 1 + 1
3 + 3
3 + 2 + 1
3 + 1 + 1 + 1
2 + 2 + 2
2 + 2 + 1 + 1
2 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1
```

## Mutable Data

We have seen how abstraction is vital in helping us to cope with the complexity of large systems. Effective programming also requires organizational principles that can guide us in formulating the overall design of a program. In particular, we need strategies to help us structure large systems to be modular, meaning that they divide naturally into coherent parts that can be separately developed and maintained.

One powerful technique for creating modular programs is to incorporate data that may change state over time. In this way, a single data object can represent something that evolves independently of the rest of the program. The behavior of a changing object may be influenced by its history, just like an entity in the world. Adding state to data is a central ingredient of a paradigm called object-oriented programming.

## The Object Metaphor

In the beginning of this text, we distinguished between functions and data: functions performed operations and data were operated upon. When we included function values among our data, we acknowledged that data too can have behavior. Functions could be manipulated as data, but could also be called to perform computation.

*Objects* combine data values with behavior. Objects represent information, but also *behave* like the things that they represent. The logic of how an object interacts with other objects is bundled along with the information that encodes the object's value. When an object is printed, it knows how to spell itself out in text. If an object is composed of parts, it knows how to reveal those parts on demand. Objects are both information and processes, bundled together to represent the properties, interactions, and behaviors of complex things.

Object behavior is implemented in Python through specialized object syntax and associated terminology, which we can introduce by example. A date is a kind of object.

```python
>>> from datetime import date
```

The name `date` is bound to a *class*. As we have seen, a class represents a kind of value. Individual dates are called *instances* of that class. Instances can be *constructed* by calling the class on arguments that characterize the instance.

```python
>>> tues = date(2014, 5, 13)
```

While `tues` was constructed from primitive numbers, it behaves like a date. For instance, subtracting it from another date will give a time difference, which we can print.

```python
>>> print(date(2014, 5, 19) - tues)
6 days, 0:00:00
```

Objects have *attributes*, which are named values that are part of the object. In Python, like many other programming languages, we use dot notation to designated an attribute of an object.

> <expression> . <name>

Above, the `<expression>` evaluates to an object, and `<name>` is the name of an attribute for that object.

Unlike the names that we have considered so far, these attribute names are not available in the general environment. Instead, attribute names are particular to the object instance preceding the dot.

```python
>>> tues.year
2014
```

Objects also have *methods*, which are function-valued attributes. Metaphorically, we say that the object "knows" how to carry out those methods. By implementation, methods are functions that compute their results from both their arguments and their object. For example, The `strftime` method (a classic function name meant to evoke "string format of time") of `tues` takes a single argument that specifies how to display a date (e.g., `%A` means that the day of the week should be spelled out in full).

```python
>>> tues.strftime('%A, %B %d')
'Tuesday, May 13'
```

Computing the return value of `strftime` requires two inputs: the string that describes the format of the output and the date information bundled into `tues`. Date-specific logic is applied within this method to yield this result. We never stated that the 13th of May, 2014, was a Tuesday, but knowing the corresponding weekday is part of what it means to be a date. By bundling behavior and information together, this Python object offers us a convincing, self-contained abstraction of a date.

Dates are objects, but numbers, strings, lists, and ranges are all objects as well. They represent values, but also behave in a manner that befits the values they represent. They also have attributes and methods. For instance, strings have an array of methods that facilitate text processing.

```python
>>> '1234'.isnumeric()
True
>>> 'rOBERT dE nIRO'.swapcase()
'Robert De Niro'
>>> 'eyes'.upper().endswith('YES')
True
```

In fact, all values in Python are objects. That is, all values have behavior and attributes. They act like the values they represent.

## Sequence Objects

Instances of primitive built-in values such as numbers are *immutable*. The values themselves cannot change over the course of program execution. Lists on the other hand are *mutable*.

Mutable objects are used to represent values that change over time. A person is the same person from one day to the next, despite having aged, received a haircut, or otherwise changed in some way. Similarly, an object may have changing properties due to *mutating* operations. For example, it is possible to change the contents of a list. Most changes are performed by invoking methods on list objects.

We can introduce many list modification operations through an example that illustrates the history of playing cards (drastically simplified). Comments in the examples describe the effect of each method invocation.

Playing cards were invented in China, perhaps around the 9th century. An early deck had three suits, which corresponded to denominations of money.

```python
>>> chinese = ['coin', 'string', 'myriad']  # A list literal
>>> suits = chinese                         # Two names refer to the same list
```

As cards migrated to Europe (perhaps through Egypt), only the suit of coins remained in Spanish decks (*oro*).

```python
>>> suits.pop()             # Remove and return the final element
'myriad'
>>> suits.remove('string')  # Remove the first element that equals the argument
```

Three more suits were added (they evolved in name and design over time),

```python
>>> suits.append('cup')              # Add an element to the end
>>> suits.extend(['sword', 'club'])  # Add all elements of a sequence to the end
```

and Italians called swords *spades*.

```python
>>> suits[2] = 'spade'  # Replace an element
```

giving the suits of a traditional Italian deck of cards.

```python
>>> suits
['coin', 'cup', 'spade', 'club']
```

The French variant used today in the U.S. changes the first two suits:

```python
>>> suits[0:2] = ['heart', 'diamond']  # Replace a slice
>>> suits
['heart', 'diamond', 'spade', 'club']
```

Methods also exist for inserting, sorting, and reversing lists. All of these mutation operations change the value of the list; they do not create new list objects.

**Sharing and Identity.** Because we have been changing a single list rather than creating new lists, the object bound to the name `chinese` has also changed, because it is the same list object that was bound to `suits`!

```python
>>> chinese  # This name co-refers with "suits" to the same changing list
['heart', 'diamond', 'spade', 'club']
```

This behavior is new. Previously, if a name did not appear in a statement, then its value would not be affected by that statement. With mutable data, methods called on one name can affect another name at the same time.

The environment diagram for this example shows how the value bound to `chinese` is changed by statements involving only `suits`. Step through each line of the following example to observe these changes.

<iframe width="800" height="500" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=chinese%20%3D%20%5B'coin',%20'string',%20'myriad'%5D%0Asuits%20%3D%20chinese%0Asuits.pop%28%29%0Asuits.remove%28'string'%29%0Asuits.append%28'cup'%29%0Asuits.extend%28%5B'sword',%20'club'%5D%29%0Asuits%5B2%5D%20%3D%20'spade'%0Asuits%5B0%3A2%5D%20%3D%20%5B'heart',%20'diamond'%5D&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

Lists can be copied using the `list` constructor function. Changes to one list do not affect another, unless they share structure.

```python
>>> nest = list(suits)  # Bind "nest" to a second list with the same elements
>>> nest[0] = suits     # Create a nested list
```

According to this environment, changing the list referenced by `suits` will affect the nested list that is the first element of `nest`, but not the other elements.

```python
>>> suits.insert(2, 'Joker')  # Insert an element at index 2, shifting the rest
>>> nest
[['heart', 'diamond', 'Joker', 'spade', 'club'], 'diamond', 'spade', 'club']
```

And likewise, undoing this change in the first element of `nest` will change `suit` as well.

```python
>>> nest[0].pop(2)
'Joker'
>>> suits
['heart', 'diamond', 'spade', 'club']
```

Stepping through this example line by line will show the representation of a nested list.

<iframe width="800" height="350" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=suits%20%3D%20%5B'heart',%20'diamond',%20'spade',%20'club'%5D%0Anest%20%3D%20list%28suits%29%0Anest%5B0%5D%20%3D%20suits%0Asuits.insert%282,%20'Joker'%29%0Ajoke%20%3D%20nest%5B0%5D.pop%282%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

Because two lists may have the same contents but in fact be different lists, we require a means to test whether two objects are the same. Python includes two comparison operators, called `is` and `is not`, that test whether two expressions in fact evaluate to the identical object. Two objects are identical if they are equal in their current value, and any change to one will always be reflected in the other. Identity is a stronger condition than equality.

```python
>>> suits is nest[0]
True
>>> suits is ['heart', 'diamond', 'spade', 'club']
False
>>> suits == ['heart', 'diamond', 'spade', 'club']
True
```

The final two comparisons illustrate the difference between `is` and `==`. The former checks for identity, while the latter checks for the equality of contents.

**List comprehensions.** A list comprehension always creates a new list. For example, the `unicodedata` module tracks the official names of every character in the Unicode alphabet. We can look up the characters corresponding to names, including those for card suits.

```python
>>> from unicodedata import lookup
>>> [lookup('WHITE ' + s.upper() + ' SUIT') for s in suits]
['♡', '♢', '♤', '♧']
```

This resulting list does not share any of its contents with `suits`, and evaluating the list comprehension does not modify the `suits` list.

You can read more about the Unicode standard for representing text in the [Unicode section](http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/strings.html#one-ring-to-rule-them-all) of Dive into Python 3.

**Tuples.** A tuple, an instance of the built-in `tuple` type, is an immutable sequence. Tuples are created using a tuple literal that separates element expressions by commas. Parentheses are optional but used commonly in practice. Any objects can be placed within tuples.

```python
>>> 1, 2 + 3
(1, 5)
>>> ("the", 1, ("and", "only"))
('the', 1, ('and', 'only'))
>>> type( (10, 20) )
<class 'tuple'>
```

Empty and one-element tuples have special literal syntax.

```python
>>> ()    # 0 elements
()
>>> (10,) # 1 element
(10,)
```

Like lists, tuples have a finite length and support element selection. They also have a few methods that are also available for lists, such as `count` and `index`.

```python
>>> code = ("up", "up", "down", "down") + ("left", "right") * 2
>>> len(code)
8
>>> code[3]
'down'
>>> code.count("down")
2
>>> code.index("left")
4
```

However, the methods for manipulating the contents of a list are not available for tuples because tuples are immutable.

While it is not possible to change which elements are in a tuple, it is possible to change the value of a mutable element contained within a tuple.

<iframe width="800" height="300" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=nest%20%3D%20%2810,%2020,%20%5B30,%2040%5D%29%0Anest%5B2%5D.pop%28%29&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

Tuples are used implicitly in multiple assignment. An assignment of two values to two names creates a two-element tuple and then unpacks it.

## Dictionaries

Dictionaries are Python's built-in data type for storing and manipulating correspondence relationships. A dictionary contains key-value pairs, where both the keys and values are objects. The purpose of a dictionary is to provide an abstraction for storing and retrieving values that are indexed not by consecutive integers, but by descriptive keys.

Strings commonly serve as keys, because strings are our conventional representation for names of things. This dictionary literal gives the values of various Roman numerals.

```python
>>> numerals = {'I': 1.0, 'V': 5, 'X': 10}
```

Looking up values by their keys uses the element selection operator that we previously applied to sequences.

```python
>>> numerals['X']
10
```

A dictionary can have at most one value for each key. Adding new key-value pairs and changing the existing value for a key can both be achieved with assignment statements.

```python
>>> numerals['I'] = 1
>>> numerals['L'] = 50
>>> numerals
{'I': 1, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'V': 5}
```

Notice that `'L'` was not added to the end of the output above. Dictionaries are unordered collections of key-value pairs. When we print a dictionary, the keys and values are rendered in some order, but as users of the language we cannot predict what that order will be. The order may change when running a program multiple times.

Dictionaries can appear in environment diagrams as well.

<iframe width="800" height="400" frameborder="0" src="https://pythontutor.com/iframe-embed.html#code=numerals%20%3D%20%7B'I'%3A%201,%20'V'%3A%205,%20'X'%3A%2010%7D%0Anumerals%5B'L'%5D%20%3D%2050&codeDivHeight=400&codeDivWidth=350&cumulative=false&curInstr=0&heapPrimitives=nevernest&origin=opt-frontend.js&py=3&rawInputLstJSON=%5B%5D&textReferences=false"> </iframe>

The dictionary type also supports various methods of iterating over the contents of the dictionary as a whole. The methods `keys`, `values`, and `items` all return iterable values.

```python
>>> sum(numerals.values())
66
```

A list of key-value pairs can be converted into a dictionary by calling the `dict` constructor function.

```python
>>> dict([(3, 9), (4, 16), (5, 25)])
{3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```

Dictionaries do have some restrictions:

- A key of a dictionary cannot be or contain a mutable value.
- There can be at most one value for a given key.

This first restriction is tied to the underlying implementation of dictionaries in Python. The details of this implementation are not a topic of this text. Intuitively, consider that the key tells Python where to find that key-value pair in memory; if the key changes, the location of the pair may be lost. Tuples are commonly used for keys in dictionaries because lists cannot be used.

The second restriction is a consequence of the dictionary abstraction, which is designed to store and retrieve values for keys. We can only retrieve *the* value for a key if at most one such value exists in the dictionary.

A useful method implemented by dictionaries is `get`, which returns either the value for a key, if the key is present, or a default value. The arguments to `get` are the key and the default value.

```python
>>> numerals.get('A', 0)
0
>>> numerals.get('V', 0)
5
```

Dictionaries also have a comprehension syntax analogous to those of lists. A key expression and a value expression are separated by a colon. Evaluating a dictionary comprehension creates a new dictionary object.

```python
>>> {x: x*x for x in range(3,6)}
{3: 9, 4: 16, 5: 25}
```
