## Inheritance

When working in the object-oriented programming paradigm, we often find that different types are related. In particular, we find that similar classes differ in their amount of specialization. Two classes may have similar attributes, but one represents a special case of the other.

For example, we may want to implement a checking account, which is different from a standard account. A checking account charges an extra $1 for each withdrawal and has a lower interest rate. Here, we demonstrate the desired behavior.

```python
>>> ch = CheckingAccount('Spock')
>>> ch.interest     # Lower interest rate for checking accounts
0.01
>>> ch.deposit(20)  # Deposits are the same
20
>>> ch.withdraw(5)  # withdrawals decrease balance by an extra charge
14
```

A `CheckingAccount` is a specialization of an `Account`. In OOP terminology, the generic account will serve as the base class of `CheckingAccount`, while `CheckingAccount` will be a subclass of `Account`. (The terms *parent class* and *superclass* are also used for the base class, while *child class* is also used for the subclass.)

A subclass *inherits* the attributes of its base class, but may *override* certain attributes, including certain methods. With inheritance, we only specify what is different between the subclass and the base class. Anything that we leave unspecified in the subclass is automatically assumed to behave just as it would for the base class.

Inheritance also has a role in our object metaphor, in addition to being a useful organizational feature. Inheritance is meant to represent *is-a* relationships between classes, which contrast with *has-a* relationships. A checking account *is-a* specific type of account, so having a `CheckingAccount` inherit from `Account` is an appropriate use of inheritance. On the other hand, a bank *has-a* list of bank accounts that it manages, so neither should inherit from the other. Instead, a list of account objects would be naturally expressed as an instance attribute of a bank object.

##   Using Inheritance

First, we give a full implementation of the `Account` class, which includes docstrings for the class and its methods.

```python
>>> class Account:
        """A bank account that has a non-negative balance."""
        interest = 0.02
        def __init__(self, account_holder):
            self.balance = 0
            self.holder = account_holder
        def deposit(self, amount):
            """Increase the account balance by amount and return the new balance."""
            self.balance = self.balance + amount
            return self.balance
        def withdraw(self, amount):
            """Decrease the account balance by amount and return the new balance."""
            if amount > self.balance:
                return 'Insufficient funds'
            self.balance = self.balance - amount
            return self.balance
```

A full implementation of `CheckingAccount` appears below. We specify inheritance by placing an expression that evaluates to the base class in parentheses after the class name.

```python
>>> class CheckingAccount(Account):
        """A bank account that charges for withdrawals."""
        withdraw_charge = 1
        interest = 0.01
        def withdraw(self, amount):
            return Account.withdraw(self, amount + self.withdraw_charge)
```

Here, we introduce a class attribute `withdraw_charge` that is specific to the `CheckingAccount` class. We assign a lower value to the `interest` attribute. We also define a new `withdraw` method to override the behavior defined in the `Account` class. With no further statements in the class suite, all other behavior is inherited from the base class `Account`.

```python
>>> checking = CheckingAccount('Sam')
>>> checking.deposit(10)
10
>>> checking.withdraw(5)
4
>>> checking.interest
0.01
```

The expression `checking.deposit` evaluates to a bound method for making deposits, which was defined in the `Account` class. When Python resolves a name in a dot expression that is not an attribute of the instance, it looks up the name in the class. In fact, the act of "looking up" a name in a class tries to find that name in every base class in the inheritance chain for the original object's class. We can define this procedure recursively. To look up a name in a class.

1. If it names an attribute in the class, return the attribute value.
2. Otherwise, look up the name in the base class, if there is one.

In the case of `deposit`, Python would have looked for the name first on the instance, and then in the `CheckingAccount` class. Finally, it would look in the `Account` class, where `deposit` is defined. According to our evaluation rule for dot expressions, since `deposit` is a function looked up in the class for the `checking` instance, the dot expression evaluates to a bound method value. That method is invoked with the argument 10, which calls the deposit method with `self` bound to the `checking` object and `amount` bound to 10.

The class of an object stays constant throughout. Even though the `deposit` method was found in the `Account` class, `deposit` is called with `self` bound to an instance of `CheckingAccount`, not of `Account`.

**Calling ancestors.** Attributes that have been overridden are still accessible via class objects. For instance, we implemented the `withdraw` method of `CheckingAccount` by calling the `withdraw` method of `Account` with an argument that included the `withdraw_charge`.

Notice that we called `self.withdraw_charge` rather than the equivalent `CheckingAccount.withdraw_charge`. The benefit of the former over the latter is that a class that inherits from `CheckingAccount` might override the withdrawal charge. If that is the case, we would like our implementation of `withdraw` to find that new value instead of the old one.

**Interfaces.** It is extremely common in object-oriented programs that different types of objects will share the same attribute names. An *object interface* is a collection of attributes and conditions on those attributes. For example, all accounts must have `deposit` and `withdraw` methods that take numerical arguments, as well as a `balance` attribute. The classes `Account` and `CheckingAccount` both implement this interface. Inheritance specifically promotes name sharing in this way. In some programming languages such as Java, interface implementations must be explicitly declared. In others such as Python, Ruby, and Go, any object with the appropriate names implements an interface.

The parts of your program that use objects (rather than implementing them) are most robust to future changes if they do not make assumptions about object types, but instead only about their attribute names. That is, they use the object abstraction, rather than assuming anything about its implementation.

For example, let us say that we run a lottery, and we wish to deposit $5 into each of a list of accounts. The following implementation does not assume anything about the types of those accounts, and therefore works equally well with any type of object that has a `deposit` method:

```python
>>> def deposit_all(winners, amount=5):
        for account in winners:
            account.deposit(amount)
```

The function `deposit_all` above assumes only that each `account` satisfies the account object abstraction, and so it will work with any other account classes that also implement this interface. Assuming a particular class of account would violate the abstraction barrier of the account object abstraction. For example, the following implementation will not necessarily work with new kinds of accounts:

```python
>>> def deposit_all(winners, amount=5):
        for account in winners:
            Account.deposit(account, amount)
```

We will address this topic in more detail later in the chapter.

##   Multiple Inheritance

Python supports the concept of a subclass inheriting attributes from multiple base classes, a language feature called *multiple inheritance*.

Suppose that we have a `SavingsAccount` that inherits from `Account`, but charges customers a small fee every time they make a deposit.

```python
>>> class SavingsAccount(Account):
        deposit_charge = 2
        def deposit(self, amount):
            return Account.deposit(self, amount - self.deposit_charge)
```

Then, a clever executive conceives of an `AsSeenOnTVAccount` account with the best features of both `CheckingAccount` and `SavingsAccount`: withdrawal fees, deposit fees, and a low interest rate. It's both a checking and a savings account in one! "If we build it," the executive reasons, "someone will sign up and pay all those fees. We'll even give them a dollar."

```python
>>> class AsSeenOnTVAccount(CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount):
        def __init__(self, account_holder):
            self.holder = account_holder
            self.balance = 1           # A free dollar!
```

In fact, this implementation is complete. Both withdrawal and deposits will generate fees, using the function definitions in `CheckingAccount` and `SavingsAccount` respectively.

```python
>>> such_a_deal = AsSeenOnTVAccount("John")
>>> such_a_deal.balance
1
>>> such_a_deal.deposit(20)            # $2 fee from SavingsAccount.deposit
19
>>> such_a_deal.withdraw(5)            # $1 fee from CheckingAccount.withdraw
13
```

Non-ambiguous references are resolved correctly as expected:

```python
>>> such_a_deal.deposit_charge
2
>>> such_a_deal.withdraw_charge
1
```

But what about when the reference is ambiguous, such as the reference to the `withdraw` method that is defined in both `Account` and `CheckingAccount`? The figure below depicts an *inheritance graph* for the `AsSeenOnTVAccount` class. Each arrow points from a subclass to a base class.

![img](./img/multiple_inheritance.png)

For a simple "diamond" shape like this, Python resolves names from left to right, then upwards. In this example, Python checks for an attribute name in the following classes, in order, until an attribute with that name is found:

```python
AsSeenOnTVAccount, CheckingAccount, SavingsAccount, Account, object
```

There is no correct solution to the inheritance ordering problem, as there are cases in which we might prefer to give precedence to certain inherited classes over others. However, any programming language that supports multiple inheritance must select some ordering in a consistent way, so that users of the language can predict the behavior of their programs.

**Further reading.** Python resolves this name using a recursive algorithm called the C3 Method Resolution Ordering. The method resolution order of any class can be queried using the `mro` method on all classes.

```python
>>> [c.__name__ for c in AsSeenOnTVAccount.mro()]
['AsSeenOnTVAccount', 'CheckingAccount', 'SavingsAccount', 'Account', 'object']
```

The precise algorithm for finding method resolution orderings is not a topic for this text, but is [described by Python's primary author](http://python-history.blogspot.com/2010/06/method-resolution-order.html) with a reference to the original paper.

##   The Role of Objects

The Python object system is designed to make data abstraction and message passing both convenient and flexible. The specialized syntax of classes, methods, inheritance, and dot expressions all enable us to formalize the object metaphor in our programs, which improves our ability to organize large programs.

In particular, we would like our object system to promote a *separation of concerns* among the different aspects of the program. Each object in a program encapsulates and manages some part of the program's state, and each class statement defines the functions that implement some part of the program's overall logic. Abstraction barriers enforce the boundaries between different aspects of a large program.

Object-oriented programming is particularly well-suited to programs that model systems that have separate but interacting parts. For instance, different users interact in a social network, different characters interact in a game, and different shapes interact in a physical simulation. When representing such systems, the objects in a program often map naturally onto objects in the system being modeled, and classes represent their types and relationships.

On the other hand, classes may not provide the best mechanism for implementing certain abstractions. Functional abstractions provide a more natural metaphor for representing relationships between inputs and outputs. One should not feel compelled to fit every bit of logic in a program within a class, especially when defining independent functions for manipulating data is more natural. Functions can also enforce a separation of concerns.

Multi-paradigm languages such as Python allow programmers to match organizational paradigms to appropriate problems. Learning to identify when to introduce a new class, as opposed to a new function, in order to simplify or modularize a program, is an important design skill in software engineering that deserves careful attention.
